# Hi, I'm Ayesha Latif

I’m a passionate web developer learning modern tools and techniques by working on various self-driven web development projects. My projects also include converting a UI design into pixel-perfect HTML/React code, using custom CSS, and applying frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I’m focusing on adding interactivity to websites, improving performance optimization, and expanding my knowledge of full-stack technologies.

I’m seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills to contribute effectively to an organization’s goals while continuing to learn and grow in the field.
